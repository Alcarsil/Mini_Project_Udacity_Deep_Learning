# Mini Project Udacity
Dermatologist AI Deep Learning NanoDegree 2020

datasets: Udacity Deep Learning NanoDegree 2020 / Deep Learning in Cancer Detection - Class 8
model: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train
classes: melanoma, nevus and seborrheic keratosis.
(hyperparameters by default)

model accuracy (first experience): 64%
model accuracy (second experience): 66% - removing color noise (pen marks) from nevus datasets.

problems: small datasets and nevus overestimated by having the biggest image samples.
